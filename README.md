# 🏥 Healthcare Admissions Dashboard – Power BI Project

This Power BI dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of hospital patient admissions, outcomes, department-wise trends, and critical case insights. The project simulates a real-world healthcare dataset with unstructured data, making it a strong demonstration of end-to-end data analysis, cleaning, transformation, and visualization skills.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To design and develop a fully interactive healthcare dashboard using Power BI that enables:

- Trend tracking of patient admissions over time
- Outcome distribution insights
- Department-level workload analysis
- KPI cards for executive-level summary
- Dynamic filtering by gender and department

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Interactive KPIs**: Total Patients, Average Stay Duration, % Critical Cases, Recovery Rate
- **Time Series Analysis**: Monthly admissions trend using cleaned date columns
- **Categorical Breakdown**: Department-wise and Outcome-wise visualizations
- **Data Cleaning**: Replaced nulls, standardized inconsistent labels, created custom columns
- **Slicers**: Real-time filtering by Gender and Department
- **Grouped Insights**: Combined rare outcomes into “Other” category for better clarity

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The original dataset was intentionally unstructured to simulate real-world messiness:

- Converted Excel serial dates to actual date format
- Trimmed and capitalized categorical values
- Handled `(Blank)` values by replacing with `"Unknown"` or `"Unassigned"`
- Created calculated columns for `MonthYear`, `Stay Duration`, and grouped outcomes

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop**
- Power Query M Language
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Excel (source data)
